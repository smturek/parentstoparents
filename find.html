              What is your go-to treatment for working with a child or adolescent with anorexia?

            <ul>
              <li>
                If they do not identify or use FBT, ask them directly about it.
                Although FBT will not work for all anorexics, any informed
                mental health worker supporting someone with anorexia
                should know about FBT.   Regardless of the therapy ultimately
                decided on, nutritional rehabilitation needs to begin ASAP.

            <ul>
              <li>
                If there are serious medical and/or psychiatric issues like
                extremely low or high heart rate or serious suicidality,
                hospitalization most likely will be needed.  Nutritional
                rehabilitation needs to be a main focus.

                There are no medications specifically for anorexia.Â 
                There are medications for other mental illnesses that
                often co-occur with anorexia like depression, anxiety,
                obsessive compulsive disorder and bipolar.  However,
                often weight needs to be gained before the medicines
                work well.

          At this time it is still difficult to find clinicians trained in the Family-Based Maudsley Treatment
          approach. Unfortunately, many parents will find that their local clinicians are either unfamiliar with
          or openly dismissive of the approach. It will take time for information and training to find its way
          into widespread practice, but parents can travel to evidence-based clinics for treatment or arrange
          for consultations between modern clinics and local resources. Clinicians interested in learning
          about or training in the approach can contact TRAIN2TREAT4ED.com.
