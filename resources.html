            <h3 class="margin-bottom-20">Causes of Anorexia*</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20">The exact cause of anorexia nervosa is unknown. As with many disorders, it's probably
                a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Biological</strong> - Although it's not yet clear which genes are involved, there may be
                  changes that make some people more vulnerable to developing anorexia. Some people may
                  have a genetic tendency toward perfectionism, sensitivity and perseverance — all traits
                  associated with anorexia.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Psychological</strong> - Some emotional characteristics may contribute to anorexia. Some
                may have obsessive-compulsive personality traits that make it easier to stick to strict diets
                and forgo food despite being hungry. They may have an extreme drive for perfectionism,
                which causes them to think they're never thin enough. And they may have high levels of
                anxiety and engage in restrictive eating to reduce it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Environmental</strong> - Modern Western culture emphasizes thinness. Success and worth
                often equated with being thin. Peer pressure may help fuel the desire to be thin, particularly
                among young girls.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin-top-20"><span class="font-size-18">*</span> <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia/basics/causes/con-20033002">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia/basics/causes/con-20033002</a></p>

          <div>
            <h3 class='margin-bottom-20 border-top'>Risk Factors**</h3>
            <p class='margin-bottom-20'>Certain factors increase the risk of anorexia nervosa, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Being female</strong> - Anorexia is more common in girls and women. However, boys and men
                been increasingly developing eating disorders, perhaps because of growing social
                pressures.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Young age</strong> - Anorexia is more common among teenagers. Still, people of any age can
                develop this eating disorder, though it's rare in those over 40. Teens may be more
                susceptible because of all the changes their bodies go through during puberty. They also
                may face increased peer pressure and be more sensitive to criticism or even casual
                comments about weight or body shape.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Genetics</strong> - Changes in certain genes may make people more susceptible to anorexia.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Family history</strong> - Those with a first-degree relative — a parent, sibling or child — who had
                the disease have a much higher risk of anorexia.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Weight changes</strong> - When people lose or gain weight — on purpose or unintentionally —
                those changes may be reinforced by positive comments from others if weight was lost or by
                negative comments if there was a weight gain. Such changes and comments may trigger
                someone to start dieting to an extreme. In addition, starvation and weight loss may change
                the way the brain works in vulnerable individuals, which may perpetuate restrictive eating
                behaviors and make it difficult to return to normal eating habits.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transitions</strong> - Whether it's a new school, home or job; a relationship breakup; or the death or
                illness of a loved one, change can bring emotional stress and increase the risk of anorexia.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sports, work and artistic activities</strong> - Athletes, actors, dancers and models are at higher
                risk of anorexia. Coaches and parents may inadvertently raise the risk by suggesting that
                young athletes lose weight.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Media and society</strong> - The media, such as TV and fashion magazines, frequently feature a

                parade of skinny models and actors. These images may seem to equate thinness with

                success and popularity. But whether the media merely reflect social values or actually drive

                them isn't clear-cut.
              </li>
            </ul>
