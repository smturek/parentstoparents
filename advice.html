          Suggestions from recovered anorexics after watching the documentary:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure parents know that anorexia does not mean your child does not eat.  It means that s/he
            restricts dangerously, but still eats.  Parents can see their child eat and feel that because s/he is
            eating, the issue is not anorexia.  Anorexia can be present and dangerous and the child can be seen
            eating.
          </li>
          <li>
            The time needed for each of FBT’s phases is individually tailored.  It is important for parents to
            know that relapses are very common.  A sufferer may go into phase 2 for a month and then need to
            go back to phase one.  It can be a back-and-forth battle between the phases for a few months or
            several years or even a lifetime.  The sooner anorexia is tackled, however, the quicker full recovery
            is possible.  Anorexia can last a few months, a few years or a lifetime.

        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Advice from Parents of Anorexics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don’t allow your child to stay at a thin weight.  Too often our culture accepts too thin, just not
            anorexically thin, as the ideal.  In our experiences, and statistically speaking, those who get at or
            above their ideal target weight and maintain that weight for 2 years have a very high likelihood of
            never struggling with anorexia again.  Parents, challenge your own perceptions of what is beautiful
            and healthy.  For an anorexic, staying thin may be an ingredient for relapses.
