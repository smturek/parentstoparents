        <p class="margin-bottom-20">
          We are a group of parents who have had a child or adolescent suffer through  mental illness(es) and desire to help other parents who have a child with mental illness(es).

        <h3 class="margin-bottom-20">Why We Do What We Do</h3>
        <p class="margin-bottom-20">
          We feel driven  to help other parents gain understanding of the mental illnesses’ impact on the brain and personality and to help them find evidence-based support as quickly as possible.   At the time of our children’s struggles, we made mistakes.  Many mistakes. We had no map of where to go; no idea which theories and therapies would work; and we were unaware of the research which supported specific  theoretical perspectives over others.  We desire to provide a "map" to help other parents.

      <div>
        <h3 class="margin-bottom-20">Our Mission</h3>
        <p class="margin-bottom-20">
          Our goal is to provide clear, practical, and evidence‐based information and suggestions to parents on how to respond to mental  illnesses, as well as criteria to consider when selecting a psychotherapist for the family and/or child for each mental illness. We hope to both empower parents with the knowledge and skills to respond to their adolescents mental illness(es)  in compassionate yet effective ways; and to provide a synopsis of current research regarding each mental illness to help parents make informed, evidence‐based decisions regarding their treatment options.
